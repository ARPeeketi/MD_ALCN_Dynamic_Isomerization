# Molecular_Dynamics_Dynamic_Isomerization
The repository contains the LAMMPS and python scripts employed for molecular dynamic simulations of the dynamic isomerization of azo-molecules embedded in liquid crystal polymers. The simulation results present a convincing numerical evidence for the photo-activated density changes in azo-modified liquid crystal polymers. The codes are developed by Akhil Reddy Peeketi at Indian Institute of Technology Madras. 

The developed framework and the results are published online at [Arxiv](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2305.14990) "Photo-activated dynamic isomerization induced large density changes in liquid crystal polymers: A molecular dynamics study" Akhil Reddy Peeketi, Edwin Joseph, Narasimhan Swaminathan, Ratna Kumar Annabattula.
